# Video Game Recommendation Website

This website suggests video game titles based on a personality quiz to make it easier to find new games to play. Users can also read or write reviews on games they have played or are thinking about playing. 

Any user can take the test and find a variety of different games that might fit their playstyles, as the quiz is more of a questionaire than a 'quiz.' We wanted an accessible and approachable way to discover new games, as many mainstream are overwhelming in their recommendations or lack the personalization to make meaningful suggestions.

# Development

During our development process, we primarily used PHP, CSS, Oracle VM VirtualBox, VisualStudio Code, Github, AWS, and SQL to complete the website. 

To create a development environment similar to the one used by most group members, you will need to do the following: 
* Download Oracle VM VirtualBox
* Create a VM using Ubuntu Linux 20.01 (or the latest current distro)
* Install VisualStudio Code on the VM 
* Download the .zip file from our GitHub respository and open it in VisualStudio Code

# Project Status

As the project was for a class, development has most likely drawn to an end as of the beginning of March. Expect few or no additional commits. 

# Features

* Quiz: Take a quiz and receive reocmmendations on games we think you'll enjoy. 
* Profiles/add friends: Create a profile with your name and an image (you can upload a .jpg/.png of your choice). Become friends with other users on the site or just visit their profile pages to see reviews they have published.
* Read reviews/write reviews: Read what the internet has to say about a variety of games, or write about a game yourself.
