# Profiles

This folder contains image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif) assigned to a user's profile. The user uploads this image through the website where it is saved in this file within the database. 

## Usage

There is no code in this folder. After files are uploaded by a user, there should not be much of a reason to interact with the folder unless there is a storage overflow. 

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
