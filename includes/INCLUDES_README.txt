# Includes

This folder contains PHP helper files essential to the overall functionality of our website. These files contribute to the mechanics of the website, including error handling, upload specifications, and other important procedures. 

## Usage

There should be no need to interact with the raw code of these PHP files. Each of these helper files are connected to a central PHP file and are fully functional through the website's interface.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
